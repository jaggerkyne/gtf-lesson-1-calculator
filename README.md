### This is the calculator app for Assignment 1 at Tealeaf Academy.

This is a simple command line app that takes two numbers from user and perform simple calculations.

The app makes assumption that user will enter a number into the system, given an integer or decimal number.

If the user enter something else, the app will break at this stage.


Additional features will be added in the future as I go deeper into the world of Ruby:

1. Verfiy all user input before performing the calculation using Regex. (done)
2. Try not to repeat myself, calculator could be refactored.
